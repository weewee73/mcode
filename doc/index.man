INDEX(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  INDEX(3)



NAME
       index, rindex - locate character in string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       char *index(const char *s, int c);

       char *rindex(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The index()  function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The rindex() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The terminating NULL character is considered to be a part of the strings.

RETURN VALUE
       The index() and rindex() functions return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if the character is not found.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD;  marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001.
       POSIX.1-2008 removes the specifications of index() and rindex(), recommending strchr(3) and strrchr(3) instead.
