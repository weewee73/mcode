NAME
       stat - display file or file system status

SYNOPSIS
       stat [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Display file or file system status.

       -L, --dereference
              follow links

       -Z, --context
              print the SELinux security context

       -f, --file-system
              display file system status instead of file status

       -c  --format=FORMAT
              use  the  specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a new-
              line after each use of FORMAT

       --printf=FORMAT
              like --format, but interpret backslash escapes, and do not  out-
              put  a  mandatory  trailing  newline.   If  you  want a newline,
              include \n in FORMAT.

       -t, --terse
              print the information in terse form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       %b     Number of blocks allocated (see %B)

       %B     The size in bytes of each block reported by %b

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %d     Device number in decimal

       %D     Device number in hex

       %f     Raw mode in hex

       %F     File type

       %g     Group ID of owner

       %G     Group name of owner

       %h     Number of hard links

       %i     Inode number

       %n     File name

       %N     Quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link

       %o     I/O block size

       %s     Total size, in bytes

       %t     Major device type in hex

       %T     Minor device type in hex

       %u     User ID of owner

       %U     User name of owner

       %x     Time of last access

       %X     Time of last access as seconds since Epoch

       %f     Free blocks in file system

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %i     File System ID in hex

       %l     Maximum length of filenames

       %n     File name

       %s     Block size (for faster transfers)

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually super-

       mentation for details about the options it supports.
