STRCHR(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 STRCHR(3)



NAME
       strchr, strrchr, strchrnul - locate character in string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchr(const char *s, int c);

       char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchrnul(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The strchrnul() function is like strchr()
           except that if c is not found in s, then it returns a pointer to the null byte at the end of s, rather than NULL.

       Here "character" means "byte"; these functions do not work with wide or multi-byte characters.

RETURN VALUE
       The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer to the matched character
           or NULL if the character is not found.

       The strchrnul() function returns a pointer to the matched character,
           or a pointer to the null byte at the end of s (i.e., s+strlen(s)) if the character is not found.

VERSIONS
       strchrnul() first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.1.

CONFORMING TO
       strchr() and strrchr() are in SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
       strchrnul() is a GNU extension.
